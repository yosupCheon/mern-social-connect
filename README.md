# MERN Social Connect (SNS) - MERN Stack Project

## Project Overview

Welcome to the MERN Social Connect (SNS) project! This project is a social networking service developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. It incorporates a range of fundamental and essential features commonly found in social networking platforms.

## Key Features (Work in Progress)

Our SNS project will aim to include the following key features:

- **User Authentication**: Users will be able to register an account and log in using one's ID and unique password.

- **User Profiles**: Users can create and customize their profiles, and provide basic information about themselves.

- **Post Sharing**: Users can create and share text-based posts, images, and potentially other types of media with their friends.

- **News Feed**: Users will have a personalized news feed that displays the latest posts and updates from their friends.

- **Likes and Comments**: Users can engage with posts by liking them and leaving comments, promoting interactions and discussions.
